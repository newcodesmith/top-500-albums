        <h1>The 500 greatest albums of all time.</h1>
        <p>
            The last 70 years have produced millions of albums for the world to listen to and explore. If you are a music lover as I
            am, you may not have enough hours in the day to sort through all these albums to find your “must haves.”
            <br> Luckily, over the last 10 years, Rolling Stone Magazine and NME have both produced lists of the best 500 albums
            of all time. If you are looking to start, grow, or complete your own music collection, these lists are a fun
            place to start.

                The RS 500 was assembled by the editors of Rolling Stone, based on the results of two extensive polls. In 2003, Rolling Stone
                asked a panel of 271 artists, producers, industry executives and journalists to pick the greatest albums
                of all time. In 2009, we asked a similar group of 100 experts to pick the best albums of the 2000s. From
                those results, Rolling Stone created this new list of the greatest albums of all time.

                NME has released its list of the Top 500 Albums of All Time, and it’s a doozy. Now, keep in mind, this is a British music
                magazine, so the fact that six of the top 10 acts are British shouldn’t be terribly surprising. There are
                also no women or black artists in the top 10. Apparently voting was done rather last minute, and the magazine
                got in touch with writers and staff from years past to compile their personal lists before tallying up all
                the votes.
